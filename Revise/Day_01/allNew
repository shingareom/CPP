Manipulator

In C++ programming, language manipulators are used in the formatting of output. The two most commonly used manipulators are: "endl" and "setw".

    "endl" is used for the next line.
    "setw" is used to specify the width of the output.

An example program to show the working of a manipulator is shown in figure 3.
