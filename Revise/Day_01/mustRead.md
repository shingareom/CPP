Yes, you've got it right! Here's a more detailed explanation:

### **Structure (struct)**
- When you create a structure variable, **all members** of the structure get their own separate memory allocation.
- The total memory size of the structure is the sum of the sizes of all its members.
- Even if you use only one member, the memory for the other members is still allocated, and they occupy memory at the same time.

#### Example of a structure:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Data {
    int i;
    float f;
    char str[20];
};

int main() {
    struct Data data;
    
    // Here, memory is allocated for all members: int, float, and char[20]
    data.i = 10;
    data.f = 20.5;
    snprintf(data.str, sizeof(data.str), "Hello");
    
    printf("data.i: %d\n", data.i);
    printf("data.f: %.2f\n", data.f);
    printf("data.str: %s\n", data.str);
    
    return 0;
}
```
In this case, **all members** (`int`, `float`, and `char[]`) get memory allocated even if you are not using some of them at the moment.

---

### **Union**
- In contrast, when you create a union variable, **all members share the same memory space**.
- At any given time, only **one member** of the union can hold a value, but the memory allocated will be the size of the largest member.
- When you assign a value to one member, it overwrites the memory previously used by another member, which is why only one member is "active" at any time.

#### Example of a union:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
    char str[20];
};

int main() {
    union Data data;
    
    // Memory is shared between all members
    data.i = 10;        // stores integer
    printf("data.i: %d\n", data.i);
    
    data.f = 220.5;     // stores float, overwrites integer
    printf("data.f: %.2f\n", data.f);
    
    snprintf(data.str, sizeof(data.str), "Hello");  // stores string, overwrites float
    printf("data.str: %s\n", data.str);
    
    return 0;
}
```
In this case, only **one member** of the union (`int`, `float`, or `char[]`) occupies memory at a time. The memory allocated for the union is the size of the largest member, and only that member is "active" at a time.

---

### Key Differences:
- **Structure**: Each member gets its own memory location, and the total memory used is the sum of all the members' sizes.
- **Union**: All members share the same memory location, and the memory used is equal to the size of the largest member. Only one member is active at any given time.

So, in summary:
- **Structure**: Memory is allocated for all members simultaneously.
- **Union**: Memory is shared, and only the currently used member occupies that memory.



Function overloading in C++ allows you to define multiple functions with the same name, but with different parameter types or a different number of parameters. The **compiler** uses this information to distinguish between the overloaded functions at compile time, allowing it to generate the correct machine code to call the appropriate function. 

Let's break down how this works at the **low level**, including what happens in the **compiler**, **assembler**, and **during function call resolution**.

### 1. **Function Overloading Mechanism (At Compile Time)**

When you write code with function overloading, like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void print(int x) {
    cout << "Integer: " << x << endl;
}

void print(double x) {
    cout << "Double: " << x << endl;
}

void print(const char* x) {
    cout << "String: " << x << endl;
}

int main() {
    print(5);        // Calls print(int)
    print(3.14);     // Calls print(double)
    print("Hello");  // Calls print(const char*)
    
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. **How the Compiler Handles Function Overloading**

- **Name Mangling**: C++ compiler internally uses a technique called **name mangling** to differentiate overloaded functions. Name mangling is the process of encoding the function signature (including the types of parameters) into the function name to ensure each overloaded function gets a unique name.

  For example, after mangling:
  - `print(int)` might become `_Z5printi`
  - `print(double)` might become `_Z5printd`
  - `print(const char*)` might become `_Z5prints`

  The compiler generates these unique names by incorporating information about the function's name, parameter types, and other relevant details (like const, reference, etc.) into the symbol.

- **Function Signature Resolution**: At compile time, the compiler resolves which overloaded version of the function to call based on the argument types passed during the call.

  - When you call `print(5)`, the compiler knows that `5` is an integer, so it calls the mangled version of `print(int)`.
  - When you call `print(3.14)`, the compiler knows that `3.14` is a `double`, so it calls the mangled version of `print(double)`.
  - When you call `print("Hello")`, the compiler recognizes `"Hello"` as a `const char*` (a C-string literal), so it calls the mangled version of `print(const char*)`.

### 3. **At the Assembler and Machine Code Level**

After the compiler generates the appropriate object code for each overloaded function, the **assembler** and **linker** handle the translation of these functions into machine code. Here's how:

- **Object Code Generation**: The compiler translates each overloaded function into machine code, but the name of the function (e.g., `print`) is replaced with the mangled name (`_Z5printi`, `_Z5printd`, `_Z5prints`).
  
- **Linking**: The linker resolves these mangled names and ensures that when you call `print(5)`, the correct version (e.g., `_Z5printi`) is linked into the program.

- **Memory Addressing**: Each mangled function name corresponds to a specific memory address in the executable. The linker adjusts the code to call the correct memory address based on the types of arguments passed in the function call.

### 4. **How the Compiler Knows the Type of the Argument**
At runtime, when you call a function, the types of arguments are known by the **compiler** at compile time. This is because:

- **Function Call Resolution**: The compiler knows the types of the arguments because they are explicitly written in the code (like `print(5)` or `print(3.14)`).
- The compiler selects the appropriate overload based on the type of the argument. This is resolved statically (at compile time) for all basic types (e.g., `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`).

For **complex types**, the compiler may need additional information (such as function signatures or template instantiations) to choose the correct function.

### 5. **Types in Memory**

At the machine code level:
- **Basic Types** (like `int`, `char`, `double`, etc.) are simply integers, floating-point values, or memory addresses, and the type is determined by how they are passed and interpreted.
- **Character or String**: When you pass a `const char*` (string literal), it is a pointer to the first character of the string in memory. The compiler distinguishes between `const char*` and other types using type information provided in the function's signature.

### **Summary of the Process:**
1. **Function Overloading Resolution**: The compiler resolves the correct overloaded function based on the types of arguments.
2. **Name Mangling**: The compiler generates unique names for each overloaded function to differentiate them (e.g., `_Z5printi` for `print(int)`).
3. **Linking and Address Resolution**: The linker ensures that the correct function version is called by resolving mangled names into addresses.
4. **Machine Code**: At runtime, the correct function is called based on the mangled name and passed arguments.

Thus, the compiler uses the **argument types** passed in the function call to determine which overloaded version to call. At the assembler and machine code level, the unique mangled names are used to ensure the correct version of the function is executed.


# This IS Possible

```cpp
class Employee{
            // Class definition
} harry, rohan, lovish;
```


# Nesting of Member Functions

- If one member function is called inside the other member function of the same class it is called nesting of a member function. A program to demonstrate the nesting of a member function is shown below.
